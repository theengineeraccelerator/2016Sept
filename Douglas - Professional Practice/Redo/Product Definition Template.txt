Detailed Behavior
   Initial State: Initial State
       EVENT 1
            # Plug in sheild to arduino to provide power
                # Open communication port up to input
                    # Wait for input
Detailed Behavior
    State: Recieve input
       Input is being recieved
            # PWM out based on observed input
                # Check for input every half a second
                    # Stop output if no input is recieved
Detailed Behavior
   State: Off 
       Unplugged from Arduino
            # Power Down
