Product Description:  Arduino Kiln Controller

Introduction:
The Kiln is for processing neon and plasma artwork.  An electrode is attached to a recycled bottle and the bottle must be heated to drive off contaminants before the bottle is filled with a small amount of noble gas.  The kiln is used for the heat processing, and must allow the bottle to be attached to the vacuum manifold during the heat processing.  Once the bottle has been processed and removed, it can be hooked to a power supply and the plasma will glow with various effects within the bottle.

Notes:
Can upgrade to a power switch, to turn on and off the heating states without unplugging. This switch can go between the main power and everything, or just between the relay and the power to prevent the element from coming on.
