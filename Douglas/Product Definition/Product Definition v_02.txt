Arduino DDS Tone Shield Definition


Introduction
There is currently no easy way to achieve a tone sign wave using the current arduno uno rev 3 board. This project looks to become an accessory to the Arduino Uno board that will generate a tone by utilizing 
A direct digital snythesizer in conjunction with a low pass chebyshev filter.

Behavior Definition


Product States:
	+ Intital Power On State
	
	+ Idle State
	
	+ Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State
		
	+ Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
		
	+ Off State

   Initial State: Initial State
       Arduino Uno power on
      	   # Blink State indicator three times to confirm operational power	
          	  # Play one tone for one second to confirm functionality of speaker
             	 	# Check state status for operational state
                  	 	 # Change state indicator light to comply with the state
				 # If manual state indicator is chosen, generate signal in accordance to Variable Frequency Controller
					# If manual state indicator is not chosen, open up communication port to arduino uno to recieve instructions on standby

    State: Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State
       Input is being recieved
            # PWM out to drive speaker based on observed input from Arduino
                # Check for change in state change indicator every milisecond
                    # Check for aditional signal commands from arduino uno every milisecond
			# If no aditional commands recieved, stop generating additional pwm driven signals to speaker and change to Idle State

   State: Idle State 
       Micro Controller is set to Idle
            # Scan for change in State change indicator
		# Wait to recieve instructions from Arduino Uno
                

   State: Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
       The State Switch has been activated
            # Check to see if State Switch has been deactivated
		# If State switch is deactivated, return to idle state
		# If state Switch Activated, drive speaker with pwm signal and repeat test of state switch activation


   State: Off 
       Unplugged from Arduino
            # Nothing happens


Interface List
   Arduino <--> Shield
    Characteristics
        -Physical pin connections that conform vertically to the physical dimensions of the Arduino Uno
	-Header Pins must be compatable with additional Arduino Uno shields vertically such that two of these sheilds can be stacked
	 vertically and mechanically one ontop of the other as you would stack this ontop of an arduino
